# Contents
The model provides the required torque, depending on joint angle position, velocity and acceleration input parameters, as well as, the moving vehicle (base) acceleration input parameter. 
The acceleration input of the base is set to a ramp acceleration. 
The results can be viewed graphically by simulating the model in Simulink.
